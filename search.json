In this study, we focus on factories in the\r\nBangladesh ready-made garment (RMG) industry that supply North American\r\nand European retailers, as upstream suppliers in supply chains. The\r\nsetting is unique, because with supply chains now extending into\r\ndeveloping countries, time and again, working conditions in supplier\r\nfactories have been found to be unsafe. After the disasters (e.g,\r\nbuilding collapse, plant fire, etc.) the global retailers have adopted\r\nan innovative approach to improving the working conditions of supplier\r\nfactories by forming consortiums. The consortium of North American\r\nretailers is the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety (Alliance). The\r\nconsortium of European retailers is the Accord on Fire and Building\r\nSafety in Bangladesh (Accord). The central question addressed in this\r\nstudy is: How do working conditions in a supplier factory impact its\r\ntrustworthiness as seen from a retailer’s perspective? Our empirical\r\nanalyses support the contention that retailers are sensitive to working\r\ncondition risks in a supplier factory, i.e., as working condition risks\r\nin a supplier factory increase, its trustworthiness decreases. However,\r\nthese relationships vary with the type of risk. The above findings,\r\ntaken together, provide nuanced insights into the marketplace\r\nimplications of working condition risks in supplier factories. Link\r\nHow\r\ndoes supplier CSR performance help to expand exchange relationships with\r\nmajor buyers? The moderating role of supply-side and demand-driven\r\nuncertainty [DS]\r\nI continue to investigate the implications of corporate social\r\nresponsibility (CSR) performance on the supplier-buyer relationship in a\r\nsupply chain context. Most existing works have been conducted from the\r\nbuyer’s perspective. We take the supplier’s perspective and examine how\r\nsuppliers leverage their CSR performance to expand exchange\r\nrelationships with major customers. Specifically, we examine whether two\r\nsupplier CSR performance dimensions—environmental and product\r\nperformance—can serve as a mechanism to expand a supplier’s\r\nrelationships with a smaller number of major buyers (which are developed\r\nto measure the exchange dependence relationship). We develop a\r\nlarge-scale longitudinal sample and find empirical evidence that a\r\nsupplier’s environmental and product performance relate positively to\r\ngreater customer dependence and improved financial performance across\r\ndiverse sets of industries. However, the findings also reveal that both\r\ndemand-driven and supply-side uncertainty can weaken the effect.\r\nSpecifically, the positive effect of environmental performance tends to\r\nweaken in the face of supply-side uncertainty, whereas the positive\r\neffect of product performance tends to weaken amid demand-driven\r\nuncertainty. Our study contributes to the understanding of CSR from the\r\nresource dependence and social exchange perspective in supply chains.

In this\r\npublished paper, we examine the relationship between technology\r\nlicensing and firm productivity. From an operational perspective, we\r\ninvestigate the role of knowledge sourcing and its contingency in the\r\nimprovement of firm performance in developing economies. We study firms\r\nfrom South and East Asian countries and their adoption and use of\r\nforeign technology licensing to strengthen their technology capability\r\nand the implication on firms’ productivity growth. To investigate this,\r\nwe analyze detailed data of manufacturing firms in the developing\r\neconomies. Our results indicate that the adoption of foreign technology\r\nby developing economy manufacturing firms has a substantial short-run\r\ndisruptive effect on firm operations with productivity growth declining\r\nby 4.5 percentage points in these firms relative to comparable firms\r\nthat do not use foreign technology licensing. Toward mitigating such\r\ndisruptive effects, we find that formal workforce training programs\r\nattenuate the negative relationship between technology licensing and\r\nproductivity growth. However, infrastructural constraints in the\r\nexternal business environment amplify this negative relationship.\r\nIntriguingly, our results suggest that corruption in the firm’s external\r\nenvironment can attenuate the negative impact of technology licensing on\r\nproductivity growth. Link\r\nHow much\r\ndoes the firm’s alliance network matter? [SMJ]\r\nNetwork is critical in operations and supply chain management, and in\r\nthis study, we further explore the broad role of alliance network on\r\nfirm performance. Extant work partitioning the variance in firm\r\n(business segment) profitability has identified industry, corporate\r\nparent, business segment, and time as key factors. However, this\r\nvariance decomposition research stream has overlooked the role of\r\nnetwork. We employ a fast-unfolding community-detection algorithm to\r\ndetect firms’ network memberships and use the Shapley Value method to\r\nisolate the effect of the firm’s alliance network, in addition to\r\nindustry, corporate parent, business segment, and year effects, on the\r\nvariance in business unit performance. Our findings demonstrate that the\r\neffect of the firm’s alliance network explains 11% of the variance in\r\nfirm ROA among 16,381 business segments from 1979 through 1996. Our\r\nresults also hold when we extend the time period through 2018. Thus, our\r\nstudy provides strong empirical evidence that alliance networks of firms\r\nare critical to firm value creation. Link\r\nGovernment\r\nsupport and cross-border innovation: The Effect of China’s innovative\r\ncity policy on chinese firms’ patenting in the U.S. [POM]\r\nIn this project, we study how government support influence firms’\r\ncross-border innovation. Firms innovate their new processes and products\r\nnot only within their countries, but also across national boundaries.\r\nThis is known as cross-border innovation. Like many countries, China\r\ninitiated the national “innovative city” policy 2009 and has been\r\nsupporting global innovation of firms in selected cities, to converge\r\nwith more developed countries. Informed by Porter’s Diamond Model, we\r\nconceptualize government support as slack resources and investigates how\r\nit affects a firm’s inventive activities in an uncertain, competitive\r\nglobal market. This study examines Chinese firms’ patent filings in the\r\nU.S. under the enactment of the “innovative city” policy. We apply\r\nmatching and generalized difference-in-differences (DiD) techniques to\r\nthis staggered quasi-experimental setting and find that government\r\nsupport stimulates firms’ cross-border innovation. We further show that\r\nfirms with higher R&D capacity take better advantage of government\r\nsupport. Finally, we show that government support leads to a rebalancing\r\nof exploratory and exploitative innovation such that a firm that has\r\nconducted more exploration will perform more exploitation and vice\r\nversa. Taken together, this study extends our understanding of slack\r\nfrom internal resources to government support in the context of global\r\noperations. Findings suggest that government actions that improve the\r\necosystem of innovation in one country strengthen firms’ innovation and\r\ncompetitiveness overseas. Link\r\nCan\r\nbots help create knowledge? The effects of bot intervention in open\r\ncollaboration [DSS]\r\nOver the past two decades, operations have become an essential part\r\nof management for many digital platforms. My recent work investigates\r\nthe implication of the use of automated algorithmic agents, bots, on\r\nuser participation and collaboration on a digital platform. This is\r\nbecause many open collaboration platforms (e.g., Wikipedia) have\r\nrecently utilized bots to solve the issue of stagnating user\r\nparticipation. However, the impact of such a bot agent on user\r\nactivities in open collaboration is unclear. In this study, we examine\r\n(i) whether bot intervention affects user participation, and (ii)\r\nwhether the impact of bot intervention could vary by characteristics of\r\nopen collaboration works. Utilizing a rich dataset from an online open\r\ncollaboration platform from 2005 to 2017, we study two types of unique\r\nbots and their interactions with human users. The results from a\r\ndifference-in-differences approach provide strong evidence that bot\r\nintervention in open collaboration leads to unintended consequences as\r\nit significantly demotivates user participation. We further show that\r\nthe negative effect of bot intervention is alleviated if more active\r\nusers are engaged or if covered topics have a higher concentration in\r\ncollaboration work. This provides directions for businesses to resolve\r\nthe unintended demotivation problem in utilizing bot agents. Link\r\nHow\r\nmuch do customer ordering practices drive medical supplies distribution\r\n(in)efficiency for primary care markets? [POM]\r\nIn this project, we study how a leading wholesale distributor in the\r\nbusiness-to-business (B2B) primary care marketplace manages efficient\r\ndistribution while facing various customer ordering behaviors. This\r\ndistributor specializes in providing non-acute health care products to\r\nphysician practices, community health centers, and urgent care centers\r\nacross multiple product categories within the U.S. medical supplies\r\nindustry. Our focus in on understanding how customer ordering practies\r\nimpact supply chain distribution performance, utilizing the theoretical\r\nlens of data clumpiness, which relates to patterns of data\r\nnon-conformity in terms of equal spacing. To conduct our analysis, we\r\ncreate a sample from a comprehensive invoice database spanning several\r\nyears. We employ mixed-effects modeling techniques, accounting for\r\ncross-level interactions between product categories and customer\r\norganizations. Our findings reveal that customers who exhibit less\r\nclumpiness in their order-sizing and greater clumpiness in their\r\norder-timing practices contribute to increased distribution efficiency\r\nfor the wholesale distributor. These effects are more pronounced when\r\ncustomers have greater experience within specific product categories and\r\nare less significant when ordering across multiple categories.\r\nAdditionally, we observe that industry customers’ use of centralized\r\npurchasing tends to decrease the efficiency of the wholesale\r\ndistributor. However, these negative effects can be mitigated when\r\ncustomers prioritize replenishment based on their actual needs and\r\nmaintain consistent order sizing. Overall, our study not only offers\r\npractical implications but also extends our theoretical understanding of\r\ninventory management in relation to intermediary supply chain\r\ndistribution efficiency. Link\r\nThe\r\nmoderating effects of knowledge characteristics on the financial value\r\nof innovative technology products [JOM]\r\nThe development of innovative technology products is both costly and\r\nrisky, and their economic value is highly uncertain. Developing a sample\r\nof 312 innovative technology products introduced between 1987 and 2006\r\nin the U.S. and a long-horizon event study with control firms, I explore\r\nthe impact of innovative technology products on the long-term financial\r\nperformance of a firm. In particular, we examine how the knowledge\r\ncharacteristics of the firm, which embrace its knowledge absorptive\r\ncapacity, knowledge impact, and knowledge diversity, moderate such an\r\nimpact. We find that on average an innovative technology product\r\nincreases the firm’s return on assets (ROA) (relative to control firms)\r\nby 2.18% in the second year after product introduction. However, the\r\nvalue of an innovative technology product varies with the knowledge\r\ncharacteristics of the firm that invented it. We find that the financial\r\nimpact of technology products is stronger when firms have higher\r\nknowledge absorptive capacity, and more impactful and less diversified\r\nknowledge (as measured by patents). We classify firms into three\r\ncategories based on their knowledge characteristics. We find that firms\r\nwith a high knowledge fit increase their ROA by 4.55% after product\r\nintroduction, while those with a low knowledge fit receive no benefit\r\nfrom the innovative technology products at all.\r\nLink\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In particular, I aim to understand\r\n            1) how firms encompass innovative and responsible operation\r\n            practices in the value creation process, and 2) given the\r\n            emerging need, how firms develop and manage their technology\r\n            effectively, in their own country and the global\r\n            markets.\r\n            To address research questions in these two streams, I\r\n            conduct analysis through the application of empirical and\r\n            computational methods involving statistics, econometrics,\r\n            machine learning, psychometrics, and data analytics.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Interests\r\n            Innovation and Technology Management for Sustainable and\r\n            Responsible Operations Management\r\n            Empirical and Computation Methods with Statistics,\r\n            Econometrics, and Data Analytics\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Education/Work\r\n            Post-doctoral Senior Researcher, 2018University of\r\n            Virginia, Darden School of Business\r\n            Ph.D. in Supply Chain and Operations Department,\r\n            2016University of\r\n            Minnesota, Carlson\r\n            M.Phil. in Logistics and Maritime Studies, 2011Hong Kong Polytechnic\r\n            University\r\n            B.A. in Bio-medical English and B.M. in E-Business,\r\n            2009Peking University,\r\n            China\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Selected Publications\r\n            Towards improving factory working conditions in\r\n            developing countries: An empirical analysis of Bangladesh\r\n            Ready-Made garment factories\r\n            The moderating effects of knowledge characteristics\r\n            of firms on the financial value of innovative technology\r\n            products\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Teaching\r\n            SCMA 675 - Operations Management\r\n            SCMA 320 - Production and Operations Management\r\n            SCMA 302 - Business Statistics II\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Contact\r\n            Email\r\n            301 West Main Street, Richmond, Virginia 23284-4000,\r\n            USA\r\n            \r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Xiaojin (Jim) Liu\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Google Scholar\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      ORCID\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Email\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Assistant Professor\r\n              Supply Chain Management and Analytics\r\n              School of Business\r\n              Virginia Commonwealth University\r\n              Download my CV (PDF): Curriculum\r\n              Vitae\r\n              I am an assistant professor of Supply\r\n              Chain Management and Analytics at the School of Business,\r\n              Virginia Commonwealth\r\n              University.
